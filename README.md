# Capstone_Project
- The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts the best insurance
cost for an individual based on their health and lifestyle habits. This
involves analyzing factors like age, BMI, smoking habits, physical activity,
and medical history to estimate personalized insurance premiums. The aim
is to make insurance pricing fair and accurate, ensuring that people pay
based on their actual health risks. For insurance companies, this helps
create better pricing strategies and improves customer trust by offering
policies tailored to each person. It also encourages people to adopt
healthier habits by showing how their lifestyle affects their insurance costs.
Overall, this approach makes insurance more accessible, helps people
manage their health better, and creates a win-win for both customers and
insurers.
- The data provided here it’s related to users as with their medical related
history where we have many features like ‘years_of_insurance_with_us’,
‘age’, ‘gender’, ‘smoking_status’ on the basis of that we have to predict
insurance cost by using some Machine Learning Algorithm.
